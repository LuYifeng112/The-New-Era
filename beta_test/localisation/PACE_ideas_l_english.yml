DRK_heir_of_korea_desc:0 "The Democratic People's Republic of Korea is divided for decades. Either we or our enemy will inherit the peninsula and unite it under our governments. We will fight and persist for as long as we need to achieve this subordinate goal."
DRK_sanctions_idea:0 "International Sanctions"
DRK_juche_idea:0 " State Juche"
DRK_juche_idea_desc:0 " Juche is the official state ideology of North Korea, described by the government as Kim Il-sung's original, brilliant and revolutionary contribution to national and international thought. It postulates that "man is the master of his destiny", that the Korean masses are to act as the "masters of the revolution and construction" and that by becoming self-reliant and strong, a nation can achieve true socialism. The practice of Juche is firmly rooted in the ideals of sustainability through agricultural independence and a lack of dependency. The Juche ideology has been criticized by many scholars and observers as a mechanism for sustaining the totalitarian rule of the North Korean regime and justifying the country's heavy-handed isolationism and oppression of the North Korean people. It has also been described as a form of Korean ethnic nationalism, but one that promotes the Kim family as the saviours of the "Korean race" and acts as a foundation of the subsequent personality cult surrounding them."
DRK_nomenklatura_idea:0 "Korean Nomenklatura"
DRK_nomenklatura_idea_desc:0 "The nomenklatura were a category of people within the Soviet Union and other Eastern Bloc countries who held various key administrative positions in the bureaucracy, running all spheres of those countries' activity- government, industry, agriculture, education, etc., whose positions were granted only with approval by the communist party of each country or region. Virtually all members of the nomenklatura were members of a communist party. The Democratic People's Republic of Korea is no different in that it relies on this adage system to ensure state loyalty under all it's social and economic instituitions. This system has lead to corruption, increasing state fragility while it also comes at the cost of effective economic outlook and progress."
DRK_social_change_demand_idea:0 "Growing Social Instability"
DRK_songun_idea:0 "Songun - Military First"
DRK_songun_idea_desc:0 "Songun is the "military first" policy of North Korea, prioritizing the Korean People's Army in the affairs of state and allocation of resources. "Military first" as a principle guides political and economic life in North Korea, with "military-first politics" dominating the political system; "a line of military-first economic construction" acting as an economic system; and "military-first ideology" serving as the guiding ideology. Songun elevates the Korean People's Army within North Korea as an organization and as a state function, granting it the primary position in the North Korean government and society. The government grants the Korean People's Army the highest economic and resource-allocation priority and positions it as the model for society to emulate. Songun is also the ideological concept behind a shift in policies since 1994 which emphasize the people's military over all other aspects of state and society."
DRK_oversized_military_idea:0 "Oversized Korean People's Army"
DRK_oversized_military_idea_desc:0 "The Korean People's Army (KPA) has 1,106,000 active and 8,389,000 reserve and paramilitary troops, making it the largest military institution in the world. With an active duty army of 1.21 million, consisting of 4.7% of its population, the KPA is the fourth largest military force in the world after China, the United States and India. About 20 percent of men aged 17–54 serve in the regular armed forces, and approximately one in every 25 citizens is an enlisted soldier. The KPA has five branches- Ground Force, Navy, Air Force, Special Operations Force, and Rocket Force. Command of the Korean People's Army lies in both the Central Military Commission of the Workers' Party of Korea and the independent State Affairs Commission."
DRK_outdated_equipment_idea:0 "Outdated equipment & Asymetric Warfare"
DRK_outdated_equipment_idea_desc:0 "The military faces some issues limiting its conventional capabilities, including obsolete equipment, insufficient fuel supplies and a shortage of digital command and control assets due to other countries being banned from selling weapons to it by the UN sanctions. To compensate for these deficiencies, the KPA has deployed a wide range of asymmetric warfare technologies like anti-personnel blinding lasers, GPS jammers, midget submarines and human torpedoes, stealth paint, and cyberwarfare units. In 2015, North Korea was estimated as having 6,000 sophisticated computer security personnel."
DRK_Chondoism_idea:0 "Cheondoism Influence: Low"
DRK_Chondoism_idea_desc:0 "Cheondoism incorporates elements of Korean shamanism. It places emphasis on personal cultivation and social welfare in the present world and rejects most notions of an afterlife, except for cyclical reincarnation. Splinter movements include Suwunism and Bocheonism. Cheondoism as a religion evolved in the early 1900s from the Donghak peasant liberation movements in the southern provinces of Korea, particularly the unsuccessful, yet consequential, rebellion of 1894. Followers of Donghak were severely persecuted until the establishment of the Protectorate Treaty of 1905, which guaranteed freedom of religion. Therefore, on 1 December 1905, Son Byong-hi decided to modernize the religion and usher in an era of openness and transparency in order to legitimize it in the eyes of the Japanese, who had strong influence over Korea at the time. As a result, he officially changed the name of Donghak to Cheondoism (\"religion of the Heavenly Way\"). Cheondoists are nominally represented in North Korean politics by the minor Cheondoist Chongu Party."

Resources, Time and manpower must be put to use to fix this foundational problem of the nation."
